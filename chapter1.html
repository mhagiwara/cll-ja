<p>Chapter 1 Lojban As We Mangle It In Lojbanistan: About This Book</p>

<h1>第１章：本書について　「ロジバンの世界へようこそ」</h1>

<p>1. What is Lojban?</p>

<h2>1. ロジバンとは何か</h2>

<p>Lojban (pronounced “LOZH-bahn”) is a constructed language. Previous
versions of the language were called “Loglan” by Dr. James Cooke
Brown, who founded the Loglan Project and started the development of
  the language in 1955.</p>

人工言語であるロジバンは、ログラン (創始者 James Cooke Brown ) が前身で
あり、このプロジェクトは1955年にスタートした。

<p>The goals for the language were first described in the open literature
in the article “Loglan”, published in Scientific American, June,
1960.</p>

"Loglan" という題名の記事が <i>Scientific American</i> に掲載された。

<p>Made well-known by that article and by occasional references in
science fiction (most notably in Robert Heinlein's novel The Moon Is A
  Harsh Mistress and computer publications.</p>

SF小説 <i>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</i> 等で言及される。

<p>Loglan and Lojban have been built over four decades by dozens of
workers and hundreds of supporters, led since 1987 by The Logical
Language Group (who are the publishers of this book).</p>

1987年からは、Logical Language Group (LLG=この本の出版元) がロジバンの
開発を牽引している。

<p>There are thousands of artificial languages (of which Esperanto is the
best-known), but Loglan/Lojban has been engineered to make it unique
  in several ways. The following are the main features of Lojban:</p>

エスペラントをはじめ人工言語はたくさんあるが、ログラン／ロジバンには以
下のユニークな特長がある。

<p>
- Lojban is designed to be used by people in communication with each
  other, and possibly in the future with computers. - Lojban is
  designed to be neutral between cultures. - Lojban grammar is based
  on the principles of predicate logic. - Lojban has an unambiguous
  yet flexible grammar. - Lojban has phonetic spelling, and
  unambiguously resolves its sounds into words. - Lojban is simple
  compared to natural languages; it is easy to learn. - Lojban's 1300
  root words can be easily combined to form a vocabulary of millions
  of words. - Lojban is regular; the rules of the language are without
  exceptions. - Lojban attempts to remove restrictions on creative and
  clear thought and communication. - Lojban has a variety of uses,
  ranging from the creative to the scientific, from the theoretical to
  the practical. - Lojban has been demonstrated in translation and in
  original works of prose and poetry.

<p>2. What is this book?</p>

<h2>2. 本書の内容</h2>

<p>This book is what is called a “reference grammar”. It attempts to
expound the whole Lojban language, or at least as much of it as is
understood at present.</p>

この本は、言語の文法をなるべくカバーする「参照文法」である。

<p>Lojban is a rich language with many features, and an attempt has been
made to discover the functions of those features. The word “discover”
is used advisedly; Lojban was not “invented” by any one person or
  committee.</p>

ロジバンは多くの特徴を持つ言語で、特徴の持つ機能を「発見」する努力がな
されていた。ロジバンは特定の個人やグループによって発明されたものではな
い。

<p>Often, grammatical features were introduced into the language long
before their usage was fully understood. Sometimes they were
introduced for one reason, only to prove more useful for other reasons
  not recognized at the time.</p>

文法機能が導入され、後になってその用法が理解されることがよくある。

<p>By intention, this book is complete in description but not in
explanation. For every rule in the formal Lojban grammar (given in
Chapter 21), there is a bit of explanation and an example somewhere in
  the book, and often a great deal more than a bit.</p>

この本は説明ではなく記述である。21章に構文解析用の形式文法を掲載した。

<p>In essence, Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of the language, Chapter
21 gives the formal structure of the language, and the chapters in
between put semantic bones on that formal flesh. I hope that
eventually more grammatical material founded on (or even correcting)
  the explanations in this book will become available.</p>

<p>Errata: Wouldn't it make more sense to say "put semantic flesh on those formal bones"? jcowan Approved INCLUDED IN DAG-CLL</p>

2章で文法の概要を、21章で形式的な文法構造をしめし、その間の章は形式に対して意味論的な肉付けをする。

<p>Nevertheless, the publication of this book is, in one sense, the
  completion of a long period of language evolution.</p>

この本の出版は、言語の完成を意味する。

<p>With the exception of a possible revision of the language that will
not even be considered until five years from publication date, and any
revisions of this book needed to correct outright errors, the language
described in this book will not be changing by deliberate act of its
  creators any more.</p>

ロジバンは、作者によって故意的に改変されることはもう無い。

<p>Instead, language change will take place in the form of new vocabulary
--- Lojban does not yet have nearly the vocabulary it needs to be a
fully usable language of the modern world, as Chapter 12 explains ---
and through the irregular natural processes of drift and (who knows?)
  native-speaker evolution. (Teach your children Lojban!)</p>

ロジバンの進化は、実用に耐える語彙を作り出すことと、自然な（語彙の）偏
移によってのみ起こる。

<p>You can learn the language described here with assurance that (unlike
previous versions of Lojban and Loglan, as well as most other
artificial languages) it will not be subject to further fiddling by
  language-meisters.</p>

他の言語とは違い、いわゆる「言語専門家」による「改造」の心配無く学べる。

<p>It is probably worth mentioning that this book was written somewhat
piecemeal. Each chapter began life as an explication of a specific
Lojban topic; only later did these begin to clump together into a
  larger structure of words and ideas.</p>

この本は、段階的に作られている。各章では一つのトピックについて説明して、
その後全体が大きな構造にまとまっていく。

<p>Therefore, there are perhaps not as many cross-references as there
should be. However, I have attempted to make the index as
  comprehensive as possible.</p>

相互参照はあまり無いが、索引を充実させた。

<p>Each chapter has a descriptive title, often involving some play on
  qwords; this is an attempt to make the chapters more memorable.</p>

各章のタイトルは、言葉遊びになっているものがある。

<p>The title of Chapter 1 (which you are now reading), for example, is an
allusion to the book English As We Speak It In Ireland, by
P. W. Joyce, which is sort of informal reference work about
Hiberno-English. “Lojbanistan” is both an imaginary country where
Lojban is the native language, and a term for the actual community of
  Lojbanspeakers, scattered over the world.</p>

１章は <i>English As We Speak It in Ireland</i> (P. W. Joyce) のもじりであり、
"Lojbanistan" とは Lojban を母語として話す人々の仮想的な国である。

<p>3. What are the typographical conventions of this book?</p>

<h2>3. 本書の表記方法</h2>

<p>Each chapter is broken into numbered sections; each section contains a
  mixture of expository text, numbered examples, and possibly tables.</p>

各章には節があり，その中には解説文、例文、表などがある。

<p>The reader will notice a certain similarity in the examples used
throughout the book. One chapter after another rings the changes on
  the self-same sentences:</p>

本書が独学用と参考用として使えるように特徴的な表記を取っている

<p>1.1) mi klama le zarci
　　I go-to that-which-I-describe-as-a store.
  　　I go to the store.</p>

<pre>
1.1) mi klama le zarci
    (私 ～へ行く 私が～と呼ぶ 店)
    (私は店へ行く) 
</pre>

<p>will become wearisomely familiar before Chapter 21 is reached. This
method is deliberate; I have tried to use simple and (eventually)
familiar examples wherever possible, to avoid obscuring new
  grammatical points with new vocabulary.</p>

語彙の要因で新しい文法要素が分かりにくくならないように、なるべく簡単で
馴染みやすい例を意図的に使っている。

<p>Of course, this is not the method of a textbook, but this book is not
a textbook (although people have learned Lojban from it and its
predecessors). Rather, it is intended both for self-learning (of
course, at present would-be Lojban teachers must be self-learners) and
to serve as a reference in the usual sense, for looking up obscure
  points about the language.</p>

「教科書」的ではないが、本書は教科書ではなく、独習および参照に使えるも
のを意図している。

<p>It is useful to talk further about Example 1.1 for what it illustrates
about examples in this book. Examples usually occupy three lines. The
first of these is in Lojban, the second in a word-by-word literal
translation of the Lojban into English, and the third in colloquial
English.  The second and third lines are sometimes called the
“literal translation” and the “colloquial translation”
respectively. Sometimes, when clarity is not sacrificed thereby, one
or both are omitted. If there is more than one Lojban sentence, it
  generally means that they have the same meaning.</p>

例文は３行から構成される。1行目はロジバン文で、２文以上の同一の意味のも
のも含む。2行目は逐語訳・直訳、3行目は通常の訳である。
<br /># 逐語訳を割愛するので、この部分を変える必要あり<br />

<p>Words are sometimes surrounded by square brackets. In Lojban texts,
these enclose optional grammatical particles that may (in the context
of the particular example) be either omitted or included. In literal
translations, they enclose words that are used as conventional
translations of specific Lojban words, but don't have exactly the
meanings or uses that the English word would suggest. In Chapter 3,
square brackets surround phonetic representations in the International
  Phonetic Alphabet.</p>

角括弧で囲まれた語は、省略可であること意味している（IPAを表す時にも使
う）。

<p>Many of the tables, especially those placed at the head of various
sections, are in three columns. The first column contains Lojban words
discussed in that section; the second column contains the grammatical
category (represented by an UPPER CASE Lojban word) to which the word
belongs, and the third column contains a brief English gloss, not
necessarily or typically a full explanation. Other tables are
  explained in context</p>

表の構成は、ロジバンの単語、文法カテゴリ（大文字で表記）、語義・意味の
３列からなる。

<p>A few Lojban words are used in this book as technical terms. All of
these are explained in Chapter 2, except for a few used only in single
chapters, which are explained in the introductory sections of those
  chapters.</p>

専門用語として用いられている「ロジバン用語」は、第２章の末尾のリストに

<p>4. Disclaimers</p>

<h2>4. 免責事項</h2>

<p>It is necessary to add, alas, that the examples used in this book do
not refer to any existing person, place, or institution, and that any
such resemblance is entirely coincidental and unintentional, and not
  intended to give offense.</p>

本書で使用している例は実際の人物・場所・組織とは関係なく、類似性は偶然
であり意図したものではない。

<p>When definitions and place structures of gismu, and especially of
lujvo, are given in this book, they may differ from those given in the
English-Lojban dictionary (which, as of this writing, is not yet
published). If so, the information given in the dictionary supersedes
  whatever is given here.</p>

<p>5. Acknowledgements and Credits</p>

<h2>5. 謝辞</h2>

<p>Although the bulk of this book was written for the Logical Language
Group (LLG) by John Cowan, who is represented by the occasional
authorial "I", certain chapters were first written by others and
  then heavily edited by me to fit into this book.</p>

本書のメイン著者は John Cowan （「私」）であるが、他の人が書い
て私が修正したものがある。

<p>In particular: Chapter 2 is a fusion of originally separate documents,
one by Athelstan, and one by Nora Tansky LeChevalier and Bob
LeChevalier; Chapters 3 and 4 were originally written by Bob
LeChevalier with contributions by Chuck Barton; Chapter 12 was
originally written (in much longer form) by Nick Nicholas; the
dialogue near the end of Chapter 13 was contributed by Nora Tansky
LeChevalier; Chapter 15 and parts of Chapter 16 were originally by Bob
LeChevalier; and the YACC grammar in Chapter 21 is the work of several
hands, but is primarily by Bob LeChevalier and Jeff Taylor. The BNF
grammar, which is also in Chapter 21, was originally written by me,
  then rewritten by Clark Nelson, and finally touched up by me again.</p>

<p>The research into natural languages from which parts of Chapter 5 draw
their material was performed by Ivan Derzhanski. LLG acknowledges his
kind permission to use the fruits of his research.  The pictures in
this book were drawn by Nora Tansky LeChevalier, except for the
  picture appearing in Chapter 4, which is by Sylvia Rutiser.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the following people for their detailed reviews,
suggestions, comments, and early detection of my embarrassing errors
in Lojban, logic, English, and cross-references: Nick Nicholas, Mark
Shoulson, Veijo Vilva, Colin Fine, And Rosta, Jorge Llambias, Iain
Alexander, Paulo S. L. M. Barreto, Robert J. Chassell, Ivan
Derzhanski, Jim Carter, Irene Gates, Bob LeChevalier, John
Parks-Clifford (also known as “pc”), and Nora Tansky LeChevalier.
Nick Nicholas (NSN) would like to thank the following Lojbanists: Mark
Shoulson, Veijo Vilva, Colin Fine, And Rosta, and Iain Alexander for
their suggestions and comments; John Cowan, for his extensive
comments, his exemplary trailblazing of Lojban grammar, and for
solving the “manskapi” dilemma for NSN; Jorge Llambias, for his even
more extensive comments, and for forcing NSN to think more than he was
inclined to; Bob LeChevalier, for his skeptical overview of the issue,
his encouragement, and for scouring all Lojban text his computer has
been burdened with for lujvo; Nora Tansky LeChevalier, for writing the
program converting old rafsi text to new rafsi text, and sparing NSN
from embarrassing errors; and Jim Carter, for his dogged persistence
in analyzing lujvo algorithmically, which inspired this research, and
  for first identifying the three lujvo classes.</p>

<p>(省略)</p>

<p>Of course, the entire Loglan Project owes a considerable debt to James
Cooke Brown as the language inventor, and also to several earlier
contributors to the development of the language.  Especially
noteworthy are Doug Landauer, Jeff Prothero, Scott Layson, Jeff
Taylor, and Bob McIvor. Final responsibility for the remaining errors
  and infelicities is solely mine.</p>

Loglan の創始者である James Cooke Brown および貢献者の Doug Landauer,

<p>6. Informal Bibliography</p>

<h2>6. 参考文献</h2>

<p>The founding document for the Loglan Project, of which this book is
one of the products, is Loglan 1: A Logical Language by James Cooke
Brown (4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida,
U.S.A.) The language described therein is not Lojban, but is very
close to it and may be considered an ancestral version. It is
regrettably necessary to state that nothing in this book has been
approved by Dr. Brown, and that the very existence of Lojban is
  disapproved of by him.</p>

Loglan の設立時の文書 <i>Loglan 1: A Logical Language</i> (James Cooke
Brown, 4th ed. 1989, The Loglan Institute, Gainesville, Florida,
U.S.A.) がベースである。ただし、当の本人は本書の内容および Lojban の存在
そのものを否定している。

<p>The logic of Lojban, such as it is, owes a good deal to the American
philosopher W. v.O. Quine, especially Word and Object (1960,
M.I.T. Press). Much of Quine's philosophical writings, especially on
  observation sentences, reads like a literal translation from Lojban.</p>

ロジバンの論理は、<i>Word and Object</i> (W. v.O. Quine, 1960,
M.I.T. Press) によるところが大きい。特に観察文についてはロジバンの逐語
訳によく似ている。

<p>The theory of negation expounded in Chapter 15 is derived from a
reading of Larry Horn's work The Natural History of Negation.  Of
course, neither Brown nor Quine nor Horn is in any way responsible for
  the uses or misuses I have made of their works.</p>

<p>Errata: Section 6, it says "Larry Horn's work The Natural History of Negation". It would appear that everyone else calls it A Natural History of Negation, by Laurence (R.) Horn.
INCLUDED IN DAG-CLL (zort's fork at least) but needs approval</p>

15章の否定の論理は <i>A Natural History of Negation</i> (Laurence Horn, 1989, University of Chicago Press) から来ている。

<p>Depending on just when you are reading this book, there may be three
other books about Lojban available: a textbook, a Lojban/English
dictionary, and a book containing general information about
Lojban. You can probably get these books, if they have been published,
from the same place where you got this book. In addition, other books
  not yet foreseen may also exist.</p>

読者が本書を読むころには、教科書、ロジ英辞書、ロジバン概説の本が利用できるようになっているかもしれない。
